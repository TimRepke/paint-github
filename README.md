# GitHub Paint

Using this simple script, you can draw into your GitHub contribution graph. Simply clone this repo, add a 7x54px image and draw whatever you want.

Each black pixel will become a commit on a certain day, all automatically.

Run the script as follows:
```
commit.py -i <image-file> -d "2011-12-25"
```

This will paint whatever you made across the entire year 2012.

**Hint:** consider doing this in a branch, so it's easier to erase...
